# 💫 Silvia Parada's portfolio 💫

Hi 👋🏻!

This is my portfolio repository, but please note that it is **still under construction**. 👩🏻‍💻 

## 🎲 | Getting started

1. To start the project, download or fork the repository.

2. To install NPM packages & dependencies, run the following line in your terminal:
~~~
npm install
~~~

3. To be able to view the page in the browser, run:
~~~
npm start
~~~

> **Note** In this project, we can find the following files and folders:
>- The folder 📂 `src/` is the files of this web page: HTML, SCSS, JavaScript and images.
>- The folders 📚 `public/` and `docs/`, are generated automatically when we start the project. GULP reads the files found in the src/ folder, processes them and then generates them inside `public/` and `docs/`.
>- Other 📝 files found in the repository root as 'gulpfile.js', 'package.json', etc. are configuration files and we don't need to modify them.
>-  To publish on GitHub Pages and generate your page for production run the command: `npm run githubpages`.
